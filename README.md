# data_scrapping
## Scrape all the reviews(pros/cons) of a company on Glassdoor.
Since I didn't not see any API, I have tried a few codes on Github to scrape the reviews on Glassdoor. Some of them used Chromedriver(too slow) or wrote codes in a very complicated manner with some strange bugs which were out of my ability. So, I tried to write the codes on my own. 

26 lines, scrape all the pros/cons of a company. No need to log in, no download limitations(as least I have never seen).

Attention: Web data scraping and crawling aren't illegal by themselves, but it is important to be ethical while doing it.
