# data_scrapping
since I didn't not see any API, I have tried a few codes on Github to scrape the reviews on Glassdoor. Some of them used Chromedriver(too slow) or wrote codes in a very completed manner with some strange bugs which is out of my ability. So, I tried to write the codes on my own. 
26 lines, scrape all the pros/cons of a company. No need to log in, no download limitations(as lease I have never seen)

Attention: Web data scraping and crawling aren't illegal by themselves, but it is important to be ethical while doing it.
